Purpose
-------

This Objective-C code contains several methods to help you calculate dates, such as the first and last date of a month, quarter, or year. The methods are provided in a Category of `NSDate`, so they're very simple to use.

For example, here's how you would get an NSDate for the first day of this quarter:


    NSDate *myDate = [NSDate firstDayOfCurrentQuarter];
    
Or, use with NSDate instances to calculate date offsets from any date:
	
	NSDate *myDate = ... some domain specific date
	NSDate *firstQuarter = [myDate firstDayOfCurrentQuarter];
    
Originally created for use in an iOS app, which needed to filter dates when generating reports. Hence the name (NSDate+Reporting).


Usage
-----

Simply `#import "NSDate+Reporting.h"` in the file where you wish to use any of these methods, and then use them as if they were part of **NSDate** itself.

The individual methods are documented in `NSDate+Reporting.h`.
